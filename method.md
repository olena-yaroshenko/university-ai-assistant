# METHODOLOGY FOR PREPARING MASTER'S THESIS
## Economics 051 - Information Technology and Economic Modeling

## INTRODUCTION

The final stage of training specialists with higher education in specialty 051 Economics of the educational program "Information Technologies and Modeling in Economics" and the form of final certification for the student is the defense of a master's thesis.

Therefore, the master's thesis is an intellectual product that reflects all the above goals, which form the professional level of a master's degree.

The purpose of any master's thesis is to confirm the level of professional suitability of its author, educational and scientific qualifications, ability to creatively comprehend and competently perform the tasks assigned to them, conduct activities adequate to professional requirements, effectively use modern analytical computer-information tools, demonstrate independence and self-sufficiency in professional texts, discussions and public speeches, and, finally, show their ability for professional self-improvement and growth, improving their general educational culture and erudition.

These methodological guidelines describe all the structures, volume, stages of execution, formatting, and procedures for defending master's theses. Familiarization with and understanding of the material presented in this methodological development is mandatory for fifth and sixth-year students working on their respective theses, as the result of such development will be a clear algorithm for writing and defending a master's thesis.

## 1. GENERAL PROVISIONS AND ESSENCE OF THE MASTER'S THESIS

The master's thesis is the work of a graduate with a higher education level that synthesizes the results of theoretical and practical training within the framework of normative and elective components of the educational-professional program for training specialists at the "master's" level in specialty 051 Economics (educational program "Information Technologies and Modeling in Economics") and is a form of control of the integrated knowledge, skills, and abilities acquired by the student during training, necessary for performing professional duties stipulated by the educational-professional program.

The purpose of the master's thesis is to apply theoretical knowledge and practical skills acquired during the entire period of study at the "master's" level of higher education in specialty 051 Economics (educational program "Information Technologies and Modeling in Economics").

The student must prove compliance with the requirements of the "master's" level of higher education when writing and defending the master's thesis.

In terms of form and content, the ideas, solutions, and results presented in the thesis must be clearly argued and objectively analyzed by the author for their novelty, theoretical and practical value, as well as their advantages and disadvantages compared to other known scientific and practical developments on this topic. The personal contribution of the author of the thesis must strictly comply with all the requirements of the examination board for the appropriate level. Therefore, the presentation of the content of each issue of the thesis must be holistic, logical, evidence-based, explanatory, and scientifically argued. The thesis must meet the following requirements:

- formulation of an applied problem;
- contain a systematic theoretical analysis of the research object;
- justification of the research subject (selection of mathematical methods and models, information technologies);
- contain the results of personally conducted comprehensive research and analysis of applied problems in accordance with the generalized object of activity;
- be properly formatted and have all necessary supporting documents;

## 2. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MAIN STAGES OF COMPLETING THE MASTER'S THESIS

### 2.1. Topic Selection

The topic of the master's thesis should reflect the problems of functional areas of activity of the main professional functions and typical tasks of activity that form the components of the general professional competence of a master's degree in information technologies and modeling in economics. In addition, the chosen topic, as a rule, determines the directions of further scientific and professional activities of the future specialist. Therefore, the student needs to approach the choice of the master's thesis topic thoughtfully, rationally, taking into account their own scientific priorities, as well as opportunities in collecting practical material, subsequent formation of information work, and the potential for using the results of scientific research in future professional activities.

Choosing the topic of the master's thesis is one of the main stages of research for a student at the "master's" level of higher education.

The thesis topic is chosen by the student from the list approved at the department meeting and is coordinated with the scientific supervisor. An indicative list of thesis topics is provided in Appendix A.

Approval of the master's thesis topic and appointment of the scientific supervisor take place at the meeting of the Department of Economic and Mathematical Modeling and are formalized by order of the university. Clarification or change is possible in exceptional cases with the appropriate resolution of the department.

The student can propose their own research topic with mandatory justification of the expediency and relevance of its development.

When choosing a master's thesis topic, one should also consider the relevance of the topic, theoretical and applied significance, compliance with the current state and prospects of economic science and information development, compliance of the chosen research direction of the master's level student with the research problems on which the department's teachers work, availability of access to necessary statistical information about the selected research object and subject, availability of one's own developments on the topic of the work, etc.

### 2.2. Literature Review, Development of Work Plan and Related Tasks

After studying the literature, it is necessary to proceed to compiling a master's thesis plan.

The master's thesis plan should correspond to the research topic, have a logical combination of theoretical-methodological, analytical, and constructive parts.

When developing and discussing the research plan, it is necessary to compile a step-by-step calendar plan for writing the work according to the approved regulations. Failure to follow the schedule and deviation from the regulations is grounds for not allowing the student to defend the master's thesis.

It should also be taken into account that each work has its own peculiarities, which are influenced by the topic and object of research, the structure of the work, the requirements of the scientific supervisor, the availability and completeness of information sources, the degree of theoretical preparation of the student, their skills and abilities. Therefore, the content can be built in a fairly arbitrary form, most appropriate to the topic and features of the research object.

When drawing up a work plan, it is necessary to take into account the following:

- the plan should reveal the essence of the chosen topic, the direction of achieving the research goal, setting and performing individual tasks in the work;
- plan questions should be clear and disclosed in a logical sequence and interconnection.

During the execution of research tasks, the plan can be clarified and corrected.

It is advisable for the student to independently prepare several variants of the work plan. After discussing the proposed variants with the scientific supervisor, the most acceptable plan for the master's research is selected (or compiled).

### 2.3. Requirements for the Structure and Volume of the Master's Thesis

All parts of the work should have names that correspond to the specific development and be logically interconnected.

The structure of the qualification work is revealed through the following components: introduction, main part, list of used sources, appendices. The title page and table of contents are also added to the master's thesis.

The recommended volume of the master's thesis is 80-100 pages. This volume includes the list of used sources and appendices. A deviation within ±10% is allowed.

1. The first page of the master's thesis is the title page (Appendix C).
2. The table of contents is placed on the second page of the master's thesis with the names and initial page numbers of all sections, subsections, and points (if they have a heading), including the introduction, conclusions to the sections, general conclusions, appendices, list of used sources, etc. (Appendix D). The names of sections and subsections should be concise and understandable, grammatically correct, closely related to the title of the work, but not repeating it. The table of contents can take 1-1.5 pages.
3. The introduction (volume 1-2 pages) contains a general description of the work in the following sequence:
   - Relevance of the research topic: Through critical analysis and comparison with known aspects of solving the problem or research object, justify the relevance and expediency of the work. The coverage of relevance should be concise, within 1 page.
   - After defining the scientific problem, the student should show that the topic of the master's thesis has not been developed and highlighted in special literature. The specific research tasks that must be performed in accordance with this goal should be defined. The definition of tasks is usually done in the form of a list (to study, describe, establish dependencies, analyze mathematical methods or models, build a model, develop an algorithm for conducting model experiments, develop software, substantiate optimal solutions in specific economic situations using computer technologies and methods of economic and mathematical modeling, etc.). The purpose of the work is usually closely intertwined with the title of the work and should indicate what exactly is being researched in the work.
   - Mandatory elements of the introduction are the specification of the object and subject of research. The object is a process or phenomenon that generates a problematic situation and is chosen for study. The subject of research is that which allows for at least partially studying the object, in particular, research tools (for example, mathematical methods and models, information technologies, etc.). The object and subject of research as categories of scientific analysis are related to each other as general and particular. The subject of research determines the topic of the master's thesis.
   - The next mandatory element of the introduction is the choice of research methods, which are tools for the selection of factual material and are necessary to achieve the set goal. The introduction also describes other elements of the scientific process, for example, references to specific material regarding the work performed, characteristics of the main sources of information (official, scientific, literary, bibliographic, etc.). In this part, it is necessary to provide a description of the work performed by analyzing and comparing it with known ones, the expediency of implementing the results of the work in the practice of enterprises, institutions, organizations, the economy of the industry or country.
   - The introductory part ends with the disclosure of the master's thesis, providing a list of its structural elements and justification of the sequence of their arrangement.

Basic requirements for the structure of the work:

4. The main part (volume 50-70 pages) of the thesis consists of three sections, each of which involves the presence of two or three subsections.
   - the material in the sections, and within the sections in the subsections, needs to be evenly distributed, the recommended volume of sections is up to 30 pages, subsections up to 10 pages;
   - a section cannot consist of only one subsection;
   - the number of illustrations (figures and tables) in the sections should be optimal, large illustrations or tables (which occupy more than one page) should be placed in the appendices;
   - the names of the sections should not repeat the title of the work, and the names of the subsections should not repeat the names of the sections;
   - the last one or two paragraphs in each section are a concise summary of the main provisions disclosed in the content of the section;
   - conclusions are formulated for each section.

The content of the sections of the main part must accurately correspond to the topic of the master's thesis and fully disclose it. The student must demonstrate the ability to concisely, logically, and argumentatively present the material.

The first section (approximately 30 pages) structurally consists of 2-3 points, has a theoretical character, contains the main theoretical provisions of the researched problem and their essence, information about the state of development of scientific thought on this problem, as well as an analytical review of literature sources on the subject of research, critically analyzes different views, carries out their classification, substantiates the main factors influencing the state and development of the researched object, etc.

Theoretical substantiation, essence, significance, classification characteristics, history and trends of development of the research subject, methodological approaches should have certain elements of controversy, reveal one's own view of the research subject, creates prerequisites for conducting one's own applied research in the next section.

The literature review on the topic should show the author's thorough familiarity with special literature, their ability to systematize sources, critically review them, highlight the main, important, evaluate what has been done previously by other researchers, determine the main thing in the current state of the topic study. The materials of such a review need to be systematized in a certain logical connection and sequence.

The literature review should contain a concise presentation of the results of studies of this problem and a comparative analysis, a general idea of the state of the issue at the moment. As a result of the analysis, the student should come to the conclusion that this topic has not yet been disclosed (or disclosed only partially, or not in that aspect), and therefore requires further development.

It is desirable to end the first section with a brief summary regarding the need for research in this field, setting the task and using economic modeling and information technologies to solve the problem.

The second section (approximately 20-30 pages) contains an economic and mathematical analysis of the research object, substantiation and description of mathematical methods, information technologies, algorithms for solving the problem, and comparative assessments, development of a general methodology for conducting research.

In other words, in this section (the section of experimental research), the student, using appropriate computer-information technologies, conducts experimental research with models or analyzes the proposed approaches to studying the object, from which specific substantiated proposals regarding the efficiency of the object's functioning (activities of the enterprise, organization) follow. This section also reveals the content and results of one's own research, which have practical significance.

The third section (approximately 20-30 pages) consists of a complete presentation of the results of the author's own research and highlights the new contributions they make to the development of the problem, and has an applied (recommendatory) character. The section provides an assessment of the completeness of the tasks set, the results of calculations and their economic and mathematical interpretation, an assessment of their reliability and comparison.

In addition, this section contains a detailed description of the information support for the task: information about parameters and indicators that characterize a specific situation and task, the order of origin, storage, and processing of economic information, about primary and derivative documents and the technology of their processing. The work should contain data on the software implementation on a computer, the program structure, and a brief instruction for the user (in the appendices).

At the end of each section, conclusions are formulated with a concise presentation of the scientific and practical results presented in the section.

5. Conclusions are the final part of the thesis, where the relevance of the topic, assessments and generalizations made during the analysis, as well as proposals are briefly presented. The conclusions should form an idea of the degree of implementation by the author in the master's thesis of the set goal and tasks.

In the conclusions, it is necessary to emphasize the qualitative and quantitative indicators of the obtained results, substantiate the reliability of the results, set out recommendations for their use.

The volume of conclusions, as a rule, should not exceed 2-3 pages.

The information accumulated in the main part allows for the sequential and logical presentation of the obtained results, their relation to the general goal and specific tasks, defined and formulated in the introduction. The final part (general conclusions) is not created by mechanically summing up the conclusions of the previous sections but should contain what is essential, which makes up the final research results. This indicates not only the significance that follows from the final results but also the research.

When performing fundamental research, especially of a search nature, it is difficult to make a practical assessment of the work performed (unlike the applied nature). In this case, it is important to determine how successful it was to approach the solution of the main task, whether it is possible to solve it completely or partially, whether the choice of research methods and the sequence of solving problems are justified.

Conclusions can also define paths for continuing research on the topic, forms and methods of its further study, practical recommendations and proposals, which especially increase the value of theoretical or practical material.

6. The list of used sources is a component of the master's thesis and should contain information about those sources and literature that were used by the author in theoretical and practical work. It is compiled in accordance with the requirements for manuscript works prepared for publication (Appendix E). All quotes, tables, factual data should be supported by precise references to their sources.

7. Appendices are formed if necessary and contain auxiliary material necessary for the perception of the master's thesis:
   - intermediate mathematical presentations, formulas, calculations;
   - tables of auxiliary statistical or other data;
   - instructions and methods, description of algorithms and programs for solving problems on a computer, developed during the execution of the master's thesis;
   - illustrations of an auxiliary nature.

Each appendix should start on a new page and there should be a reference to it in the text of the work.

Databases and programs should be on electronic media and added to the work.

### 2.4. Requirements for Formatting the Work

The results of the conducted master's research should be presented in the work in compliance with the following requirements:

- content and concreteness;
- system and sequence;
- completeness of presentation of each thought;
- highlighting separate paragraphs in the text;
- avoiding tautology (repetition of words);
- proper (standard) formatting of the work.

#### General Rules

When performing the work, it is necessary to adhere to uniform density, contrast, and clarity of images of lines, letters, numbers, and signs.

The work should be printed using a computer on one side of a white paper sheet of A4 format (210x297 mm).

The text of the work is printed, leaving margins of the following sizes: left 30 mm, right 10 mm, top 20 mm, and bottom 20 mm. The paragraph indentation of the text of the work should be 1.25 cm. In computer typing, the font of the text editor should be 14 pt with a line spacing of 1.5, Times New Roman font.

Names of institutions, organizations, firms, software tools, surnames, and other proper names in the text of the work are given in the language of the original. It is allowed to transliterate proper names and provide names of organizations in translation into Ukrainian, adding (at the first mention) the original name.

Headings of structural parts of the work and section headings should be placed in the center of the line and printed in capital letters without a period at the end, without underlining. Headings of subsections, points, and sub-points of the work should start with a paragraph indentation and be printed in lowercase letters (except for the first capital letter), without underlining, without a period at the end. Word division in the section heading is not allowed. If the headline consists of two or more sentences, they are separated by a period. Each new section and each structural part should start on a new page. The distance between the heading (except for the heading of the point) and the following or previous text should be at least two lines. It is not allowed to print the name of a section, as well as a subsection, point, or sub-point at the bottom of the page if only one line of text follows it.

#### List of Conditional Designations, Symbols, Units, Abbreviations, and Terms

The list should be arranged in two columns. On the left, in alphabetical order, conditional designations, symbols, units, abbreviations, and terms are given, on the right, their detailed decoding.

#### Page Numbering of the Work

Pages of the work need to be numbered with Arabic numerals, sequentially throughout the text of the work. The page number is placed at the top of the page in the right corner without a period after it. The title page (the first page of the work) is included in the general page numbering, but the page number is not placed on it. The design of the title page is carried out according to Appendix D. Page numbering is carried out from the title page to the last page of the work (including illustrations and appendices) without repetitions and omissions at the top of the page in the right corner, starting from the table of contents page of the work, on which the number "2" is placed.

#### Numbering of Sections, Subsections, Points, Sub-points

Sections, subsections, points, sub-points of the work are numbered with Arabic numerals. Sections should have sequential numbering within the presentation of the work, they are denoted by Arabic numerals without a period, for example: 1, 2, and so on. A period should be at the end of the subsection number, for example: "2.3." (the third subsection of the second section). Then, in the same order, the subsection heading follows.

Points should have sequential numbering within each subsection. The point number consists of the section number, the sequential number of the subsection, and the sequential number of the point, separated by a period. A period should be at the end of the point number, for example: "1.1.1.", "1.1.2.", etc. Then, in the same order, the heading of the point is determined. If a section or subsection consists of only one point, or a point consists of only one sub-point, they are not numbered. If the text is divided only into points, they need to be numbered (except for appendices) with sequential numbers.

#### Presentation of Lists

Lists, if necessary, can be presented within points or sub-points. A colon is placed before the list. Each position in the list should be preceded by a lowercase letter of the Ukrainian alphabet with a bracket, or, without numbering, using markers. This is the so-called first level of detail. For the second level of detail, Arabic numerals with a bracket are used. Lists of the first level of detail are printed in lowercase letters with a paragraph indentation, the second with an indentation relative to the location of the first level lists.

Example:
The organization consists of the following subdivisions:
a) warehouse:
   1) ready products;
   2) raw materials;
b) sales department.

#### Formulation of Notes

Notes are placed in the work when necessary to explain the content of the text, table, or illustration. They are placed immediately after the text, table, or illustration to which they relate. One note is not numbered. The word "Note" is printed with a capital letter with a paragraph indentation, not underlined, after the word "Note" a period is placed and with a capital letter in the same line, the text of the note is given, for example:
Note. _______________________

Several notes are numbered sequentially with Arabic numerals with a period. In this case, after the word "Notes" a colon is placed and in the next line with a paragraph after the note number with a capital letter, the text of the note is given, for example:
Notes:
1. _______________________
2. _______________________

#### General Rules for Citing and Referencing Various Elements

When writing a master's thesis, it is necessary to refer to the sources or materials, individual results, ideas, and conclusions, problems, tasks, issues, the study of which it is dedicated to. Such references allow finding sources and ascertaining the reliability of the provided information. It is desirable to refer to the latest editions of publications.

Reference in the text of the work to a source is indicated by the sequential number from the list of references, highlighted by two square brackets, for example: In works [1-3]. References to individual pages used for citation can also be divided in square brackets: the first number indicates the source number in the general list of used literature, the second to the page number that contains the quote. For example: "the method of multiple correlation was rarely used in practice because it required labor-intensive calculations" [25, p.132].

When referring to sections, subsections, points, sub-points, appendices, their numbers are indicated. In this case, write: according to section 2.3...

If necessary, references to illustrations and tables of the work, the number of the figure or table is indicated in parentheses, for example: "Analyzing the level of income growth (Fig. 1.2), one can conclude..." or "Real data (Table 2.1) adequately reflect the trend of economic growth."

References to formulas and other mathematical records of the work indicate the sequential number of the formula or mathematical record in parentheses, for example: by formula (2.1).

#### Placement of Illustrations

If illustrations are not created by the author of the work, it is necessary to comply with the requirements of current legislation on copyright and make a reference when presenting them in the work.

Illustrations (block diagrams, schemes, graphs, diagrams, photographs, drawings) together with their names should be placed in the work immediately after the text where they are mentioned for the first time, or on the next page. All illustrations should have references in the work. Illustrations placed on separate pages of the work are included in the general numbering of A4 format pages and are counted as one page. Sheets of larger format are placed at the end of the work after the conclusions or recommendations (if any) in the order in which they are mentioned in the text. Illustrations are numbered with Arabic numerals (without the sign №) with sequential numbering within the section, except for illustrations given in appendices. The number of illustrations consists of the section number and the sequential number of the illustration in this section, separated by a period. For example: "Fig. 1.2." - the second figure of the first section. The name of the illustration can be under it, after the word "Fig." and the number, for example: "Fig. 3.2. Information transmission scheme".

#### Formatting of Tables

Numerical material, as a rule, is formatted in the form of tables, which are placed immediately after the text in which it is mentioned for the first time, or on the next page.

The table header starts on a new line on the left, where the word is written with a capital letter, then the ordinal number is indicated, the name of the table is written in the next line in the center. Tables are numbered with Arabic numerals with sequential numbering within the section, except for tables given in appendices. The table number consists of the section number and the sequential number of the table, separated by a period, for example: Table 1.2 - the second table of the first section.

A word that is repeated in some cell can be replaced by quotation marks, two or more words at the first repetition are replaced by the words "The same", and then by quotation marks. If numerical or other data in some row of the table are not provided, then a dash is placed in it.

A table with a large number of rows needs to be transferred to the next page. When dividing a table into parts, it is allowed to replace its header or side with the corresponding numbers of columns or rows, numbering them with Arabic numerals in the first part of the table. The word "Table" and its name are indicated above the first part of the table, above other parts, write "Continuation of the table" with the indication of the table number. Headings of columns and rows of the table begin with a capital letter, and subheadings with a lowercase letter if they form one sentence with the heading, or with a capital letter. Periods are not placed at the end of headings and subheadings of tables. Headings and subheadings of columns and rows are indicated in the singular.

All tables should have references in the text of the work.

#### Writing Formulas and Mathematical Records

Formulas and mathematical records are placed immediately after the text in which they are mentioned, in the middle of the page. Formulas and equations in the work (except for formulas and equations given in appendices) are numbered with sequential numbering with Arabic numerals within the section. Only those formulas for which there are references in the following text should be numbered. The number of the formula or equation consists of the section number and the sequential number of the formula or equation, separated by a period. The number of the formula or equation is placed at the level of the formula or equation in parentheses in the line, for example: (3.1) - the first formula of the third section.

The number of a group of formulas placed on separate lines and united by a curly bracket (parenthesis) is placed to the right of the tip of the parenthesis, which is located in the middle of the group of formulas and turned towards the number.

A number that does not fit in the line with the formula is transferred to the next line below the formula. The number of the formula during its transfer is placed at the level of the last line. If the formula is in a frame, the number of such a formula is written outside the frame on the right side opposite the main line of the formula. The number of a formula-fraction is given at the level of the main horizontal line of the formula.

The formula is part of the sentence as its equal element. Therefore, at the end of formulas and in the text before them, punctuation marks are placed according to the rules of punctuation.

Punctuation marks between formulas, which are written one after another and not separated by text, can be a comma or a semicolon directly after the formula to its number.

A colon before the formula is placed only in cases provided for by the rules of punctuation: a) if there is a generalizing word in the text before the formula; b) this is required by the construction of the text preceding the formula.

Punctuation marks between formulas with parentheses are placed inside the parenthesis. After such cumbersome mathematical expressions as determinants and matrices, punctuation marks may not be placed.

Explanation of the meanings of symbols and numerical coefficients included in the formula or equation is given directly under the formula in the sequence in which they are given in the formula or equation. The explanation of the meaning of each symbol and numerical coefficient can be given on a new line. The first line of explanation begins with a paragraph with the word "where" without a colon.

Example: It is known that

(formula)

where M - mathematical expectation, σ1, σ2 - standard deviation. If the equation cannot be placed in one line, it should be transferred after the equals sign (=) or the plus (+), minus (-) signs.

#### Formatting the List of Used Sources

The list of used sources is placed after the conclusions and should contain bibliographic descriptions of the used sources.

It is recommended to form the list of used sources in alphabetical order of the surnames of the first authors or titles.

The bibliographic description can be compiled directly from the printed work or written out from catalogs and bibliographic indexes completely, without omissions of any elements, abbreviation of names, etc.

At the beginning of the list of used sources are placed: Constitution of Ukraine, laws of Ukraine, decrees of the President of Ukraine, resolutions of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, resolutions and orders of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, reports and speeches of state figures of Ukraine. Then the list is formed according to Appendix E.

#### Rules for Formatting Appendices

Appendices are formatted as a continuation of the work on its next pages, placing the appendices in the order of appearance of references to them in the text of the work. Appendices should have a through-page numbering common with the rest of the text.

Each appendix needs to be started on a new page. In the upper right corner, the word "Appendix" is written, its serial number is indicated, and on the next line, the thematic heading is placed.

Appendices are designated sequentially by capital letters of the Ukrainian alphabet, for example: "Appendix A", "Appendix B", etc. The text of the appendix, if necessary, can be divided into subsections, points that are numbered with Arabic numerals within each appendix. In this case, before each number, the designation of the appendix (letter) and a period are placed, for example: "A.2." (the second section of Appendix A), "G.3.1." (subsection 3.1 of Appendix G), etc. Illustrations, tables, formulas, and equations placed in the text of the appendix are numbered with Arabic numerals within each appendix, for example: "Figure G.2" - the
